## What I did

- I wrote some R code to help determine which Amazon product to buy using some Bayesian Statistics
- Reviewed some Pandas operations

## What I Learned

- I needed to decide which cable to buy from Amazon and wanted to incorporate some Bayesian statistics into determining which product had better reviews (with a disparity in the number of reviews for each product). I have some thoughts on my methodology (to come). For now, here's the code in `R`.

```R
# Bayesian Analysis of Amazon Reviews

# cable A, $19.99
# 222 reviews, 4.4 stars, 74% positive (4 & 5 stars)
# Cable B, $15.99
# 638 reviews, 4.2 stars, 79% positive (4 & 5 stars)
# Csble C, $15.99
# 293 reviews, 4.5 stars, 88% positive (4 & 5 stars)
theta = seq(0, 1, .01)
plot(theta, dbeta(theta, 1 + 222*.74, 1 + 222*.26), col = "red", type="l", ylim = c(0,25),
    main="Amazon Ratings",
    xlab="Positive sentiment",
    ylab="",
    sub="for cables") # A
lines(theta, dbeta(theta, 1 + 638*.79, 1 + 638*.21), col = "blue", type="l") # B
lines(theta, dbeta(theta, 1 + 293*.88, 1 + 293*.12), col = "green") # C
legend("topleft", legend=c("A", "B", "C"),
       col=c("red", "blue", "green"), lwd=(1))
```

- Indexing in `Pandas` uses `loc` nd `iloc`. Use `iloc` for **index based selections** in the row, column format. `iloc` uses stdlib index, so the first index is included and the last is excluded. For example:

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({'Column 1': [50, 21], 'Column 2': [131, 2]})
df.iloc[0] #gives all of 0th row (i.e.)
df.iloc[:,0] #gives entire column of 'Column 1'
df.iloc[:2] #gives rows 0, and 1 of all the columns. Note how this differs from loc
```

- Use `loc` for **label based selections**. `loc` indexes inclusively. Remember this by thinking about how `loc` should be inclusive because you typically pass it strings. For example:

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame[{'Column 1': [10, 20], 'Column 2': [30, 40]}]
df.loc[0, 'Column 1'] #gives row 0, column 1
df.loc[:, ['Column 1', 'Column 2']] #gives all rows for the 2 columns
df.loc[:1] #gives rows 0, and 1 of all the columns #note how this differs from iloc
```

- Selecting conditional data. For example, select all entries in the dataframe `reviews` where the entry in the column `country` is "Italy."

```python
reviews.loc[reviews.country == 'Italy']

# Here's a useful one I forgot about
reviews.loc[reviews.country.isin(['Italy', 'France'])]
reviews.loc[reviews.price.notnull()]
```

- Some useful functions for dataframes and columns within:

```python
#for col1 I mean something like df.reviews or df['reviews'], I'm just trying to be more generalizable
df.describe()
df.col1.mean()
df.col1.unique()
df.col1.value_counts()
```

### Mapping

- To map one set of values into another, there are a couple of ways. For example, to re-mean the set of values:

```python
review_points_mean = reviews.points.mean()
reviews.points.map(lambda p: p - review_points_mean)
```

- You can also write your own mapping function and use the pandas `apply` function to enact it.

```python
def remean_points(row):
    row.points = row.points - review_points_mean
    return row
    
reviews.apply(remean_points, axis='columns')
```
