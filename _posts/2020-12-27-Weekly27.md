I needed to decide which cable to buy from Amazon and wanted to incorporate some Bayesian statistics into determining which product had better reviews (with a disparity in the number of reviews for each product). I have some thoughts on my methodology (to come). For now, here's the code in `R`.

```R
# Bayesian Analysis of Amazon Reviews

# cable A, $19.99
# 222 reviews, 4.4 stars, 74% positive (4 & 5 stars)
# Cable B, $15.99
# 638 reviews, 4.2 stars, 79% positive (4 & 5 stars)
# Csble C, $15.99
# 293 reviews, 4.5 stars, 88% positive (4 & 5 stars)
theta = seq(0, 1, .01)
plot(theta, dbeta(theta, 1 + 222*.74, 1 + 222*.26), col = "red", type="l", ylim = c(0,25),
    main="Amazon Ratings",
    xlab="Positive sentiment",
    ylab="",
    sub="for cables") # A
lines(theta, dbeta(theta, 1 + 638*.79, 1 + 638*.21), col = "blue", type="l") # B
lines(theta, dbeta(theta, 1 + 293*.88, 1 + 293*.12), col = "green") # C
legend("topleft", legend=c("A", "B", "C"),
       col=c("red", "blue", "green"), lwd=(1))
```
