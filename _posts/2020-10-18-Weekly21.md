## What I did

- SQL Practice
- Resume work on my chatbot (finally!).
- Improved work on friend classifier. I realized I never made a proper metric for the performance of my friend classifier. When I went to implement this, I realized that I needed to do a better job pre-processing.

## What I learned

- With this new version of my chatbot, my plan is the train the pytorch model with the cornell movie dialog corpus and then apply transfer learning with my facebook messenger dataset. Recently I've seen some interesting data augmentation techniques for natural language processing such as translating a sentence into another language and then back and using this back-translated sentence as a new, different sentence with the same meaning. I think I saw this with Martian AI but I came across a 2019 paper that I would like to read for my next Journal Club post.

## What I will do next

- I need to go back to my message sender predictor and do a proper train-test split to be able to give a performance metric on testing data. I'm also not positive that I did the proper UTF encoding that was messing with the original chatbot version.
