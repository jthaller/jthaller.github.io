## What I did
- Sunday: Thesis chapter #$ \LaTeX $$ writing
- Monday: Thesis chapter #$ \LaTeX $$ writing
- Tuesday: More writing, but I also redid some figures comparing simulation to experimental data.
Wednesday: 


## What I learned
- Tuesday: By including *some* disorder in the simulated bulk spectrum I made a slightly better representation of the experiment vs simulation comparison. The problem is that one of the simulation peaks doesn't cross in the same place that they very clearly cross in the experimental data. Could just be that the size difference is coded in the third peak. 

## What I will do next
