Website building, mathematica rendering, and lots of seaborn manipulation

## What I did

- Sunday: Happy Easter. I integrated plotly into my portfolio, a traditional HTML website.
- Monday: I registered a domain and revised my $$ \LaTeX $$ resume and wrote a cover letter. I also spent some more time looking at how the XANES shape changes as you change SCF parameters.
- Tuesday: Meeting. Ran new Feff bulk simulations to test the SCF parameters. Applied to a job.
- Wednesday: Stressful ERASMUS forms day. I forgot how stressful this program is with its confusing forms.

## What I learned

- Sunday: `Dash` integration would be nice, but to host files larger than 1MB you really can't get along with their free account. I got around it by hosting the `Plotly` file on a github pages and then imbedding it in an iframe in my html code.
- Monday: www is actually a subdomain that most people have to configure by default.
- Tuesday: SCF parameters look good.
- Made this sweet figure:
