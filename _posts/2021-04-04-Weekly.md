## What I did

- Sunday: Happy Easter. I integrated plotly into my portfolio, a traditional HTML website.
- Monday: I registered a domain and revised my $$ \LaTeX $$ resume and wrote a cover letter. I also spent some more time looking at how the XANES shape changes as you change SCF parameters.

## What I learned
- Sunday: `Dash` integration would be nice, but to host files larger than 1MB you really can't get along with their free account. I got around it by hosting the `Plotly` file on a github pages and then imbedding it in an iframe in my html code.
- Monday: www is actually a subdomain that most people have to configure by default.
