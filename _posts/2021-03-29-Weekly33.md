## What I did
- Monday: Got FEFF to work. Read paper: "Probing Atomic Distributions in Mono- and Bimetallic Nanoparticles by Supervised Machine Learning" Nano Lett. 2019.

## What I learned
- Monday: Windows .exe FEFF files work fine and you can run bash scripts in powershell just by typing `bash` to enter linux like mode and running calling `./file.sh` to run a script like you normally would in linux. Note, you can call bash scripts to execute .exe files in windows, but if you put the .exe files in your WSL directory and then try and call them, it won't work. 

In the paper, there were a bunch of RDF and PRDF (Partial Radial Distribution Functions). The standard deviation of the PRDF is what I'm considering as sigma in my simulations. In the paper, the STD of g(x) for the Au atoms in the RDF tended to be around .1 Angstroms.

## What I will do next
