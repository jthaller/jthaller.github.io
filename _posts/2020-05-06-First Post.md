This is my first post, and I would like to explain my plan for this blog. During my summer work with my undergraduate thesis advisor, I would have a weekly meeting with her where I presented three things: 
1. *what I did*
2. *what I learned* 
3. *what I will do next*

I found this format to be very useful and a great way to maintain accountability. Furthermore, it helped solidify my understanding of the work and cement what I learned in my memory. I plan to do this in weekly installments, but I might break down each post on a day-by-day basis. 

```python
def code_snippet_test(name):
  pass
```
