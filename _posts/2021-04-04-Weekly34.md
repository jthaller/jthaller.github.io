Website building, mathematica rendering, and lots of seaborn manipulation

## What I did

- Sunday: Happy Easter. I integrated plotly into my portfolio, a traditional HTML website.
- Monday: I registered a domain and revised my $$ \LaTeX $$ resume and wrote a cover letter. I also spent some more time looking at how the XANES shape changes as you change SCF parameters.
- Tuesday: Meeting. Ran new Feff bulk simulations to test the SCF parameters. Applied to a job.
- Wednesday: Stressful ERASMUS forms day. When will I ever escape German bureaucracy?
- Thursday: Plotted gaussian averaged spectra.

## What I learned

- Sunday: `Dash` integration would be nice, but to host files larger than 1MB you really can't get along with their free account. I got around it by hosting the `Plotly` file on a github pages and then imbedding it in an iframe in my html code.
- Monday: www is actually a subdomain that most people have to configure by default.
- Tuesday: SCF parameters look good.
- Wednesday: Made this sweet figure below. Try double clicking on one of the legend colors to view only that color. Click others to add them.

- Thursday: I made a similar plot with the gaussian averaged ones, they look pretty good. Too secret to post here though.

## What I will do next
