I didn't post anything last week because I was busy with grad school work and traveling -- I flew back home to New York from Poland.

## What I did

## What I Learned

> `str()` vs `repr()`

- They basically do the same thing, though `repr()` gives the actual string representation, which is more useful for debugging, whereas `str()` returns a cleaner form, more suitable for a non-debugging print statement. Also, `repr()` gives more sig figs when typecasting into a string.
