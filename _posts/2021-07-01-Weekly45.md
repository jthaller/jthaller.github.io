## What I learned
> What's the probability of rolling 2 six-sided dice which aren't identical and have a sum of 6?

```python
import numpy as np

d1 = np.arange(1, 7, 1)
d2 = np.arange(1, 7, 1)

combs = [(x, y) for x in d1 for y in d2] # nexted list comprehension!
tot = sum([(x != y and x + y == 6) for x, y in combs]) # clever trick I came up with because if true 1, 0 else.
return tot/len(combs)
```
> There are  urns labeled X, Y, and Z. \
> Urn  X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.\
> Urn  Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.\
> Urn  Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls. \
> One ball is drawn from each of the  urns. What is the probability that, of the  balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?

Mathematically, 

$$
(\frac{4}{7}\frac{5}{9}\frac{4}{8}) + (\frac{4}{7}\frac{4}{9}\frac{4}{8}) + (\frac{3}{7}\frac{5}{7}\frac{4}{8})
= \frac{204}{504} = \frac{17}{42}
$$

Pythonically,
```python
# create the lists
urnX = ['r' for _ in range(4)]
urnX.extend(['b' for _ in range(3)])
urnY = ['r' for _ in range(5)]
urnY.extend(['b' for _ in range(4)])
urnZ = ['r' for _ in range(4)]
urnZ.extend(['b' for _ in range(4)])

import itertools
combs = [(i) for i in itertools.product(urnX, urnY, urnZ)] # with itertools
combs = [(x, y, z) for x in urnX for y in urnY for z in urnZ] # without itertools

matches = sum([tup.count('r')==2 and tup.count('b')==1 for tup in combs])
```
