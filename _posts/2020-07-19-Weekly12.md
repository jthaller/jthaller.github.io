## What I did

- I worked a little on my chatbot. Preprocessing works. Only need to decide how to deal with emojis next.
- I started reviewing/studying for my deep learning course.

## What I learned

### Review for Test

- We need activation functions for neural networks and more complicated machine learning models in order to introduce non-linearity. If you don't have an activation function, or you have a linear activation function

## What I will do next
