# What I did
- review Einstein notation. I decided if I really want to understand neural networks, and not just know how they work, I need to drill the math into my head. There are a lot of inner products and summations, so it seemed fitting to write everything in Einstein notation.
- I've been thinking about starting a new kaggle project and moving on from NLP slightly. The jobs I'm most interested in, at the moment, are ones where implimenting recommender system is the main objective i.e. suggesting movies on netflix, songs on spotify, or art up for auction at Sotheby's.
