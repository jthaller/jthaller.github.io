## What I did
- Monday: Hurst exponent, RNN's, Hopfield Network, Boltzmann Machine, Deep Belief Network
- Tuesday: Wrote most of the $$g(r)$$ program on my trainride back from NYC.
- Wednesday: Found the error preventing my `multi-moment-gaussianator.py` from working. One of the files had two identical points, i.e. (energy_99, mu_99) = (energy_100, mu_100), and it was causing a divide by zero error in my mesh interpolation.
- Thursday: Neural Network day. I wrote lots of boiler plate code for determining the quality of fits and predictions, saving and loading models, etc. 

## What I learned 
- Monday:
- Tuesday: `df.hist(columns=[])`
- Wednesday: Don't ignore warnings. Just because the code runs, if it throws a warning, it might not be doing what you think it is. My script was throwing a divide by zero warning, but it ran, it just caused one value in a csv file to be blank and I had a hard time tracing back the cause.
- Thursday: I almost forgot to scale my training labels to be from 0-1 using:
$$
z_i = \frac{x_i - \text{Min}(x)}{\text{Max}(x)-\text{Min}(x)}
$$
