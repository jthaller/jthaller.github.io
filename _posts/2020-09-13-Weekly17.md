## What I did

- I thought about how Bayesian statistics can be applied to more real life scenarios. Specifically, how to choose the best product on Amazon given different number of reviews for similarly highly-rated products.

## What I learned

## What I will do next

- Calculate "what's the probability I get covid-19?", given my circumstance in France. I can compare that to the probability of contracting the virus in Munich and then quantify how great a risk the program has taken by scheduling this mandatory class in Montpellier. 

- Another good problem would be to think about how the statistics for the vaccine testing is probably done. There's probably some Bayesian inference to test the probability that the vaccine is safe and effective given knowledge about patients given the placebo, the success and failure rate of producing anti-bodies, etc..
