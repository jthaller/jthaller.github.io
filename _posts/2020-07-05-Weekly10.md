## What I did

- spent some time going over data structures and algorithms to procrastinate writing my volcanology presentation

## What I learned

- To test the timing of different function, you need to do a weird import so that the timing mechanism isn't cluttered and affected by other stored local variables that may affect the performance in an unforeseen way.

```python
def test1():
    l = []
    for i in range(1000):
        l = l + [i]

def test2():
    l = []
    for i in range(1000):
        l.append(i)

def test3():
    l = [i for i in range(1000)]

def test4():
    l = list(range(1000))

t1 = Timer("test1()", "from __main__ import test1")
print("concat ", t1.timeit(number=1000), "milliseconds")
t2 ... t4 = ...

---output---
concat  6.54352807999 milliseconds
append  0.306292057037 milliseconds
comprehension  0.147661924362 milliseconds
list range  0.0655000209808 milliseconds
```

- Note how much quicker list comprehension is in python. I knew this was powerful, but I had mostly been using it out of convenience before. But more importantly, I know to append instead of concatenate whenever possible.

- There's a weird bug where copying any files to the WSL directory causes files to duplicate with an `.Zone.Identifier` extension. Until this bug is fixed, I've just been deleting these duplicates with this recursive command.

```bash
find . -name "*.Identifier" -type f -delete
```

- Always do a careful inspection of your model before doing more intense trouble-shooting. I wasted a lot of time because I accidentally changed a 1 to a 100.

## What I will do next
