## What I did

- I've continued to work my way through some riddles and probability puzzles from a Quant interview prep book and a data science interview prep book.

## What I learned

- Recall the poisson distribution, which is used for calculating the probability of certain events occurring based on previous expected values. For example: sometimes

    > If, on average, 2 customers come every 3 minutes, what's the probability that 5 or fewer customers come in the next 9 minutes?

    $$
    P(x \leq 5 \mid \lambda = 6) = \sum_{x=0}^5 \frac{\lambda^x e^{-\lambda}}{x!}

    $$

    - Note, $\lambda = 6$ because if you get 2 customers in 3 minutes, you'd expect to get 6 customers in 9 minutes.

    > If there's a 80% probability of seeing a comet in one hour, what's the probability of seeing one in 15 minutes?

    - If there's an 80% probability of seeing one, then there's a 20% chance of not seeing one. Using Poisson, we can say that the probability of not seeing a comet is:

    $$
    e^{-\lambda} = .20
    $$

    - Thus the probability of not seeing one in 15 minutes (1/4 of the time) is:

    $$
    e^{-\lambda} = .20^{\frac{1}{4}} = .66
    $$

    - This means that there is a 1 - .66 = 44% chance of seeing a comet in a 15 minute period.

    > Try going the other way, if there's a 20% chance of seeing a comet in 15 minutes, what's the probability of seeing one in an hour?

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    e^{-\lambda} =& .80 \\
    e^{-4\lambda} =& .80^4 \\
    \rightarrow \text{Probability of seeing comet}& \text{ in one hour} = 1 - .80^4 = 59\%
    \end{aligned}
    $$
