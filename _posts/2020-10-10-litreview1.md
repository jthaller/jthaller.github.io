# Reverse Regression: The Algebra of Discrimination (Greene 1984)

In this first journal club, I will be recapitulating and discussing an old paper which is a prime example of how regressing x on y is not the same as regressing y on x, and how you can find seemingly conflicting statistics from the same dataset.

## Summary

This paper is a response to another paper which published two metrics to investigate whether women are paid commensurately with men. This paper tried to made this determination by running two multivariate regressions:

1. *For a give job title, education level, years experienced etc. (x1, x2, x3, ...), what would be the expected salary for a man and for a women (y)?* The regression showed that the epected salaries for a man and a woman were not equivalent, and that men were paid more.

2. *For a given salary, what are the expected qualifications for a man and a woman?* If women are being discriminated against, one would expect to find that a women would be more qualified for a job at a given salary level. This was not the case.

## Important things to know

The second case is known as a reverse regression, and it is not the equivilent of the first case. There are also a few problems with this approach: the measurement errors for each regression are not the same, there is a problem of simultaneous equation bias, and the entire second regression is kind of shady.
