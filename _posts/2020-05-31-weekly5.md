## What I did

* Worked on the backprop post. I wrote the backprop section.

## What I learned

* With regards to the backprop post, I feel much more confident in how backprop works. It's not that I didn't understand it before, but more that I have a better understanding now. It's the difference of doing a physics problem and explaining a physics propblem. These posts are my Oxbridge-Williams tutorials.

## What I will do next
