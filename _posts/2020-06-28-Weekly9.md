## What I did

- started work on the Facial keypoints project. It's a bit trickier because of the strange dimensions you need to deal with in the Tensors, and then having to figure out what dimensions get spit out after ta convolution step.

## What I learned

- Here's how you calculate the dimensions that come out of a convolutional neural network layer.

## What I will do next
