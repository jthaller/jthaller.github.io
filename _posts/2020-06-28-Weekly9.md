## What I did

- started work on the Facial key-points project. It's a bit trickier because of the strange dimensions you need to deal with in the Tensors, and then having to figure out what dimensions get spit out after ta convolution step.

## What I learned

- Here's how you calculate the dimensions that come out of a convolutional neural network layer:

> fill in later

- To write a lightning module, you need to write the following methods, as a bare minimum, within a class:

```python
class net(pl.LightningModule):
  def __init__(self, hparams):
    super(net, self).__init__()
        self.hparams = hparams
  def forward(self, x):
    pass
  def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
    pass
  def train_data_loader(self):
    pass
  def configure_optimizers(self):
    pass
```

## What I will do next
