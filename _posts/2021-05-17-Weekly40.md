## What I did
- Monday: Energy mesh interpolation codes

## What I learned
- Monday: The problem right now, is that when I went to averaged all 13,000 files into 1,000 structures, I found that the energy range for each varied enough that I couldn't just provide an energy mesh used previously for the interpolation. Even using cubic-spline interpolation, which solves this problem, doesn't work, because some simulations have 81 energy points and some have 82. This means I need to create an energy mesh that will work for all 1,000 structures and then redo my skew-norm averaged spectra as well. I might as well write a script to generalize this better, i.e. loop thorugh all 1,0000 structures and then create a map that will work for all structures. I've already written the hard parts of this code. This time, however, I want to save the mesh as a csv so that I can manually edit it more easily if needed and also use it for other structures.  

## What I will do next
