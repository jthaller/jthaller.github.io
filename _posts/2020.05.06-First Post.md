This is my first post, and I would like to explain my plan for this blog. During my summer work with my undergraduate thesis advisor, I would have a weekly meeting with her where I presented *what I did*, *what I learned*, and *what I will do next*. I found this to be very useful and a great way to maintain accountability towards learning. 

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
