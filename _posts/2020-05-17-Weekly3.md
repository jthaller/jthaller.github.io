# What I did
- Deep Learning coursework. This week's was difficult, mostly because they segmented the code in a way that was pretty unclear. For example, backpropagation was split into three different functions in three different classes. It was frustrating.
- Read another few chapters of my stats textbook. These were mostly a review of hypothesis testing and associated terms. 
- I thought about how I would build a word cloud for my facebook chat data.

# What I learned
- I realized that I didn't understand backpropagation as well as I thought. See *what I will do next*.
- Here are some important definitions to remember:


>**Null Hypothesis**: ![H_0](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Z_%7B%5Calpha%2F2%7D), the original hypothesis you're testing.
>**One- vs. Two-tailed Tests**: If the null hypothesis has ≠ vs. > or <. 
>**Significance Level**: α, the area of the normal curve outside your confidence interval. Confidence interval is 1 - α. Significance level is also the probability of having a type I error.
>**Type I Error**: α. False positive. This is when you *reject* a null hypothesis that is *actually true*.
>**Type II Error**: β. False negative. This is when you *do not reject* a null hypothesis that is *actually false*  
>**Test Power**: 1 - β. Ability of a test to detect false null hypothesis. On the internal of [0,1], 0 means your H-test is worthless, 1 means it's really good.  
> **One sample z-test vs. p-value**: For a z-test, you compute the critical values ![Z_{\alpha}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Z_%7B%5Calpha%2F2%7D) or ![Z_{\alpha/2}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Z_%7B%5Calpha%2F2%7D) for significane level of α. Then reject the hypothessis if the z-score is outside of this range. For a p-value test, you calculate the probability of observing a value as or more extreme than that observed. If p-value is too small, reject the null hypothesis.

# What I will do next
- I think I would benefit greatly from writing an article about how it works. It would likely have to be quite lengthy though, so I might create a separate post for it. It's also quite difficult to explain without figures, so it would take me some time to do it well.
