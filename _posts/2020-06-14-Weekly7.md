## What I did

- I figured out what was wrong with Colab's performance off of GPU. 

## What I learned

- Turns out trying to read data from a mounted Google Drive cripples it. Additionally, when using a model with pytroch lightning, you don't need to due a ```model.to(device)```. It takes care of that for you. Doing it myself was screwing things over. You need to download the dataset onto the notebook by something like this:

```python
trainset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=my_transform)

trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset,shuffle=True, num_workers=2)
```

or better yet download the proper dataset as follows:

```python
!mkdir /datasets
!mkdir /datasets/cifar10
!cd /datasets/cifar10 && wget https://cdn3.vision.in.tum.de/~dl4cv/cifar10.zip --no-check-certificate
!cd /datasets/cifar10 && unzip -q cifar10.zip
```

- It's best to put dropout layers after a ReLU activation and before an affine (nn.Linear()) layer
- You can achieve high scores on CIFAR 10 without convolution if you use bottling layers. 


## What I will do next
