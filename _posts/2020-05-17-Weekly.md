# What I did
- Deep Learning coursework. This week's was difficult, mostly because they segmented the code in a way that was pretty unclear. For example, backpropagation was split into three different functions in three different classes. It was frustrating.

# What I learned
- I realized that I didn't understand backpropagation as well as I thought. See *what I will do next*.

# What I will do next
- I think I would benefit greatly from writing an article about how it works. It would likely have to be quite lengthy though, so I might create a separate post for it. It's also quite difficult to explain without figures, so it would take me some time to do it well.
