# What I did
* Installed Ubuntu on a VM in Windows and set up a virtual environment
* Completed TUM Course Excercise 03 -- 3 Jupyter notebooks to build data loaders
* Continued reading stats textbook.

# What I learned
* I learned a lot about dataloading and managing large quantities of data. For example:
  - If you need to load more data than you computer has Memory, you have to do it in increments. For this, we can overload the dunder method ``__iter__`` with a generator function. For example, this function chunks the dataset into lists of 5.
  
```python
def __iter(self)__:
list = []
for x in self.dataset:
  if len(list) == 5:
    yield list
    list = []
```
or if you need to read a giant CSV, you can do this:
  
  ```python
  def csv_reader(file_name):
    for row in open(file_name, "r"):
        yield row
  ```
  
  or more simply: ``csv_gen = (row for row in open(file_name))``.
  - I learned about confidence intervals, and refreshed myself on the 68.26-95.44-99.74 rule. These are numbers that I don't ever want to forget. Here's an example of finding a confidence interval:
  > You have a sample size of 36 people and know the population std is 4. Thus the std of the sample means will be:
  <p align="center">
  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma_\bar{x} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{36}}">.
  </p>
  
   > You can then calculate the <x> (the sample mean) and say that Î¼ -- the population mean -- lies within <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\bar{x} \pm 2*\sigma_{\bar{x}}"> with 95.44% confidence. You can also change your confidence interval by loooking up the value of  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=z_{\alpha/2}">. For example, for a 95% confidence interval,  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\alpha = 1 - .95">. So you can look it up in a table and find that <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Z_{.5/2}"> = 1.96. So the confidence interval forthe population mean is:
  <p align="center">
  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mu = \bar{x} \pm Z_{\alpha/2} * \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}">
  </p>
  
  > If you don't know the population mean, you can do the same calculation but with the studentized normal score and the sample mean.
  That is to say:
    <p align="center">
    <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mu = \bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2} * \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}">
    </p>
  
  
  * I also learned how to insert latex equations into github markdown.

# What I will do next
- I have a good amount of schoolwork to do, so I will likely focus on my compsci project and do the homework for my functional materials class.
- The forecast for tomorrow looks pretty nice, so I might read more of my statistics textbook outside.
