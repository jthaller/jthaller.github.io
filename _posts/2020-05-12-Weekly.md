# What I did
* Installed Ubuntu on a VM in Windows and set up a virtual environment
* Completed TUM Course Excercise 3 -- 3 Jupyter notebooks to build data loaders
* Continued reading stats textbook.

# What I learned
* I learned a lot about dataloading and managing large quantities of data. For example:
  - If you need to load more data than you computer has Memory, you have to do it in increments. For this, we can overload the dunder method ``__iter__`` with a generator function. For example, this function chunks the dataset into lists of 5.
  
```python
def __iter(self)__:
list = []
for x in self.dataset:
  if len(list) == 5:
    yield list
    list = []
```
or if you need to read a giant CSV, you can do this:
  
  ```python
  def csv_reader(file_name):
    for row in open(file_name, "r"):
        yield row
  ```
  
  or more simply: ``csv_gen = (row for row in open(file_name))``.
  - I learned about confidence intervals, and refreshed myself on the 68.26-95.44-99.74 rule. These are numbers that I don't ever want to forget. Here's an example of finding a confidence interval:
  > You have a sample size of 36 people and know the population std is 4. Thus the std of the sample means will be <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma_\bar{x} = 4/\sqrt{36}">. You can then calculate the <x> (the sample mean) and say that Î¼ -- the population mean -- lies within <x> +- 2 * 2/3 with 95.44% confidence.
