## What I did
- Monday: Train ride back to Boston. Wrote python script to generate .inp files with different radially dispalced atoms
- Tuesday: Cleaned up the code from monday
- Wednesday: `Gaussianator.py` from start to pretty far
- Thursday: `Gaussianator.py` mostly finished. Spent a long time on the gaussian averaging function and spline options

## What I learned
- Monday: You can create dir and write files in them without having to `os.chdir()` into them. Just specify the **FULL** filepath when you go to write the file. It won't work if you specify the relative path.
- Tuesday: XANES have a greater sensitivity to changes in structure than EXAFS do, and can detect changes as small as .0001 angstroms maybe.
- Wednesday: To fix non-standardized independent variable, I mapped the points onto a standardized "Energy Mesh" via an interpolation function.
- Thursday: 1d interpolation worked well, but required the mesh to be within the points to map's range. Cublicspline does not require this and allows you to map points outside of the original range. (If the data is [1,...,9] you can map into onto a mesh of [0,..,10]).

## What I will do next
