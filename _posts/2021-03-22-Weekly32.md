## What I did
- Monday: Train ride back to Boston. Wrote python script to generate .inp files with different radially dispalced atoms
- Tuesday: Cleaned up the code from monday
- Wednesday: `Gaussianator.py` 0-mostly finished.

## What I learned
- Monday: You can create dir and write files in them without having to `os.chdir()` into them. Just specify the **FULL** filepath when you go to write the file. It won't work if you specify the relative path.
- Tuesday: XANES have a greater sensitivity to changes in structure than EXAFS do, and can detect changes as small as .0001 angstroms maybe.
- Wednesday: To fix non-standardized independent variable, I mapped the points onto a standardized "Energy Mesh" via an interpolation function.

## What I will do next
