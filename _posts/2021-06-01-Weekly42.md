## What I did
- Monday: Made a nice powerpoint of my issues with regression skew-norm. Worked on $$g(r)$$ script.
- Tuesday: Had a good meeting where I realized I was calculating MSD incorrectly. I worked on some scripts to fix these issues and finished my $$g(r)$$ script.
## What I learned 
- Monday: I'm really into using `.pipe()` and chaining commands in pandas now.
- Tuesday: Xanes is not sensitive to the whole 516 atom structure so I should only calcuate the MSD of the 13 nearest neighbors. Also $$MSD \neq shift$$ since I changed my methodology, so I have to recalcate all those MSD values as well.

## What I will do next

## Random Aside
I was doing some interview practice and typed these up while talking about beta coefficients. Figured I might as well leave them here.
The regression equation:
$$ y=\beta x + \beta_0 $$
where: 
$$ 
\beta = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} \\
\beta_0 = \bar{y} - \beta\bar{x} \\
S_{xy} = \sum(x-\bar{x})(y-\bar{y}) \\
S_{xx} = \sum(x-\bar{x})(x-\bar{x}) 
$$
The multiple regression equation is:
$$y = \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + .... + \beta_0 $$
