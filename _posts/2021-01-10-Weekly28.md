I'm getting close to my final exams so most of my time will go towards studying. Accordingly, expect a hiatus from blog postings.

## What I did

- pandas apply and map functions practice.

## What I Learned

- How to capture data outputted as a print instead of a returned value (some python package functions do this)
  - You used to have to create a capturing class and then override the dunder methods for __enter__ and __exit__, but now you can use `contextlib`.

```python
import io
from contextlib import redirect_stdout

f = io.StringIO()
with redirect_stdout(f):
    do_something(my_object)
out = f.getvalue() 
```

## What I will do next
