Note, last week is missing. Most of what I did is included in the prior week, and the rest is included here. It wasn't enough to merit its own week, because I was too busy traveling preparing my residency permit application so I don't get deported when my travel VISA expires in 7 weeks.

## What I did

- I've picked up the statistics course again
- I've continued to work through a confetti.ai reading and some of their practice on their webpage. It looks very helpful for any upcoming data science interviews, and a good way to make sure I've mastered the fundamentals.
