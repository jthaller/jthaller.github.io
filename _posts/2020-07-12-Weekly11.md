## What I did

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) project
- This was a busy week because of traveling. I didn't do much programming because I was stressed about entering Germany from the USA while a travel ban was in effect barring US passport holders from entering. My German VISA got me into the country without problems, but it was still a stressful week.

## What I learned

- RNN uses the learned values from previous iterations in its learning process. This is very useful for things like NLP

## Wheat I will do next

- I've got final exams and VISA issues to worry about. I might take a hiatus from coding for a while.
