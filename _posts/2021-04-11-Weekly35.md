## What I did

- Monday: Wrote code for multi-shell feff configuring
- Tuesday: Ran simulations and averaging codes

## What I learned

- Monday: My code shell definitions are different from what nearest neighbor coordinations shells actually are. My definitions are better for what I'm interested in testing though. (sensitivity testing)
- Tuesday: There is not much sensitivity difference between the 3rd and 4th shells (like 43 to 55 atoms)
