## What I did

- Monday: Wrote code for multi-shell feff configuring
- Tuesday: Ran simulations and averaging codes
- Wednesday: Wrote code for multi-moment gaussian weightings (i.e. control skew, kurtosis)
- Thursday: Got my multi-moment weightings code working

## What I learned

- Monday: My code shell definitions are different from what nearest neighbor coordinations shells actually are. My definitions are better for what I'm interested in testing though. (sensitivity testing)
- Tuesday: There is not much sensitivity difference between the 3rd and 4th shells (like 43 to 55 atoms)
- Wednesday: - skew = left tailed. + skew = right tailed. High kurtosis = high peakedness. low kurtosis = fat tails.
- Thursday: Still questioning whether to adjust all the new skewed distributions so that the peak is always at zero.
