For my Deep Learning class at TUM, everything is written to be used in Jupyter Notebooks in a virtual environment in Unix. Up to this point, I've done all my python work in Windows using MiniConda and toying around with WSL (Windows subsystem Linux). 

## Frustrations with WSL
The most significant problem I have with WSL is its undecipherable file system. I continually ran into problems trying to load files in while trying to call the ubuntu terminal from within Atom. Navigating within WSL was pracitcally impossible. The May 2020 windows update is supposed to address many of these issues, but I felt like I was always trying to force things to work every step of the way. Is it doable, yes certianly. But I decided it wasn't worth the effort -- with the exception of git. Git management through the Ubuntu terminal in WSL worked great.
