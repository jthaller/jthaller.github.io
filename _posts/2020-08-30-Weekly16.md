(In progress)

## What I did

- It's been last two weeks of classes and traveling. My friends at Williams are moving in for next semester, and the Germans are still giving lectures for the Spring semester. Nevertheless, I've continued my Bayesian statistics course on Coursera.

## What I learned

- MLE = Maximum Likelihood Estimate. MLE is sort of like the opposite of a probability density distribution. In this case, given a set of data, predict the probability that is most likely to produce that data.
- Expectation values for different distributions:
  > x ~ Bernoulli(p), E[x] = p(1-p)
  > x ~ Binomial(n, p), E[x] = np(1-p)
  > x ~ exp(lambda), E[x] = $$1/lambda^2$$
  > x ~ uniform 

## What I will do next

- I hate putting a project on hold, but finishing my chatbot does not seem like the best use of my coding time. I think focusing some time on recommendation systems would be more germane to the Sotheby's internship.
