## What I did

- I found a website with lots of data science and machine learning questions that might be useful for interviews. I've done pretty well on some of them, but it's also been a great way to see where I need to up-learn. For example, CVS reading and HTML parsing are things I've done before, but I couldn't do a basic example if you woke me up in the middle of the night. That needs to change.

## What I learned

- NLP
  - Lexical Analysis: Understanding the part of speech of a word
  - Syntactic Analysis: Analyzing words in a sentence for meaning
  - Semantic Analysis: Understanding exact meaning of words 
  - Disclosure Integration: Understanding the context of the text (e.g. knowing you "he" refers to from the previous sentence)
  - Pragmatic Analysis: Understanding what a section of the text is actually about.

- Two downsides to measuring variance are that it has different dimensions than the original data (because you square it, often STD is more informative), and it is prone to outliers

## What I will do next

- Since I never heard back from Sotheby's for some reason, I'm going to switch my focus back to NLP and making my chatbot. I'm tempted to start over and do the whole thing again in PyTorch this time.
